- [x] Answer question "how is content requested and resolved in IPFS"

## Key Learnings / Takeaways

- Core Architecture/process:
  - You ask for a file by its CID. IPFS uses the Kademlia DHT to search for peers that have the root block, with libp2p handling all the networking. Once found, IPFS retrieves the root block, which contains links to child blocks (thanks to the Merkle DAG structure). IPFS recursively fetches those blocks, verifies them by hash, and reassembles the original file. The complete data is what IPFS "returns" to you.
- Kademlia:
  - Kademlia DHTs are distributed dictionaries that map keys from a large keyspace to associated values.
  - The keyspace is too large to store entirely on a single machine, so it is distributed across many nodes.
  - Each node holds a portion of the keyspace and can directly access only the values associated with that portion.
  - Nodes themselves are assigned IDs within the same keyspace as the keys.
  - So when a node receives a request for a key it doesn’t have, it can forward the request to another node.
  - The initial choice of which node to contact is made using an XOR distance calculation.
  - The XOR of The node ID and the requested key gives the logical distance between them.
  - Nodes maintain more information about nearby keys and nodes through structures called k-buckets.
  - Each k-bucket corresponds to a branch in a binary tree representation of the keyspace, where the tree's height equals the number of bits in the keyspace.
  - Each step up the tree doubles the size of the addressable range, so each bucket covers distances of 2¹, 2², 2³, etc., from the node, which is always at the root of its own view.
  - Each k-bucket has a fixed capacity and stores a set number of nodes, and since distant buckets cover exponentially more space, information about far-off nodes is increasingly sparse.
  - However, a node can forward a request to one of these distant peers, which likely knows more about its own local region of the keyspace.
  - That peer can then reply with a more relevant node to contact, progressively routing the request toward the exact target.
  - As a result, the lookup process completes in O(log n) time, where n is the number of bits in the keyspace.
- Merkle:
  - Merkle DAGs are data structures where each node represents a block of data and links to other nodes by their content hashes.
  - The "Merkle" part refers to the cryptographic hashing: every node includes hashes of its children, making the structure tamper-evident.
  - The "DAG" (Directed Acyclic Graph) part means data flows in one direction and cycles aren’t allowed, ensuring a tree-like but more flexible structure.
  - Each node is identified by the hash of its content, which includes the hashes of its child nodes—so any change deep in the structure bubbles up to the root.
  - Because each hash is content-addressed, the same content will always produce the same hash, enabling deduplication and caching.
  - In IPFS, files are split into chunks, and each chunk becomes a node in the Merkle DAG, linked together to represent the full file.
  - The root node of the DAG acts as the file's Content Identifier (CID), since it cryptographically commits to the entire structure below it.
  - Since nodes can link to shared subtrees, Merkle DAGs can represent versioned or overlapping data efficiently.
  - Verifying any part of the DAG is simple—if the hash matches, the content hasn't been tampered with.
  - This makes Merkle DAGs ideal for decentralized systems where trust and immutability are essential.
- libp2p:
  - libp2p is a modular networking stack that handles peer-to-peer communication in decentralized systems like IPFS.
  - It separates the concerns of discovery, transport, connection security, and stream multiplexing, allowing each to be swapped or extended independently.
  - When two peers need to communicate, libp2p handles finding each other, establishing a secure connection, and managing multiple data streams.
  - For discovery, libp2p uses methods like mDNS (for local networks), DHT-based discovery, or relay nodes to learn about other peers.
  - For transport, it supports protocols like TCP, QUIC, and WebSockets, and can fall back to alternatives depending on network constraints.
  - Connections are secured using protocols like TLS or Noise, ensuring data integrity and authentication between peers.
  - Multiplexing allows several logical streams to share a single physical connection, so multiple requests can run in parallel efficiently.
  - libp2p assigns each peer a unique Peer ID derived from its public key, which is used to verify its identity across the network.
  - Because it's modular, libp2p can be adapted to new environments, such as browsers or constrained networks, by plugging in different components.
  - IPFS relies on libp2p for all its networking: DHT lookups, block requests, and peer communication are all powered by libp2p under the hood.

## Questions / Open Problems

- How is data verified once it's received?

## Next Steps

- Spin up docker IPFS network
- Connectthem to my local node (manual bootstrapping with `ipfs swarm` connect)
- Test file transfer between remote and local
- Document latency and peer discovery behavior
