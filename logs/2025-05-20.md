# Daily Log — 2025-05-20

## Summary

- Focused on testing file upload, pinning behavior, and garbage collection across 10 containerized IPFS nodes. Compared storage before and after GC.

## Tasks Worked On

- [x] Upload 10–20 files, test pinning + unpinning
  - created a file for each node. one by one, ran `docker cp testX.txt ipfs-nodeX:/tmp/testX.txt`
  - entered the container with exec, added the file with ipfs add (which pins by default) to pin. full command format is `docker exec ipfs-nodeX ipfs add /tmp/testX.txt`
  - ran `docker exec ipfs-nodeX ipfs pin ls QmSomeHash`, then `... rm someHash`, then `... ls someHash`
  - now all the files that have been added have been unpinned. running `ipfs cat someHash` will still at this point display the contents of the file specified by someHash
- [x] Examine .ipfs/blocks and .ipfs/datastore
  - ran `docker exec ipfs-nodeX du -sh /data/ipfs/blocks /data/ipfs/datastore` to get a size for each 
- [x] Trigger garbage collection and observe space reclaiming
  - ran `docker exec ipfs-nodeX ipfs repo gc` for all nodes
  - ran `docker exec ipfs-nodeX du -sh /data/ipfs/blocks /data/ipfs/datastore` for all nodes again to compare pre and post gc output
  - Most nodes show a small decrease in /data/ipfs/blocks size after GC (e.g., from 68.0K to 52.0K), while /data/ipfs/datastore remains the same or decreases slightly.
  - the reduction in /blocks size post-GC suggests that unpinned or orphaned blocks were successfully removed. The datastore size is less affected, as it holds metadata and persistent state.
  -`ipfs cat someHash` no longer produces text for any of the unpinned and garbage collected files

## Key Learnings / Takeaways

- Pinning: when adding a file with ipfs add, the node stores the file locally and pins it by default. to unpin the file means the node won't treat is as permanently needed. Eventually, if garbage collection runs, the node removes unpinned data. Other nodes might still have it, but that is not guaranteed.
- Storage: /blocks holds actual data blocks, /datastore contains metadata. GC affects blocks more.

## Questions / Open Problems

- Does datastore ever fully clear after GC, or does it keep minimal state permanently?

## Next Steps

- diagram the data flow of ipfs add + ipfs cat
- Try to “break” the system: delete blocks, modify configs, block ports
- Try two real-world files: 1 image, 1 large PDF
