# Daily Log — 2025-05-17

## Summary

- Deployed a 10-node IPFS cluster using Docker Compose. Nodes start cleanly, expose ports correctly, and can be addressed individually.
- Cloned and began reading through the Helia, Kubo (go-ipfs), and IPFS Cluster repositories. Focused on directory layout and high-level architecture.
- Started a documentation tree in docs/ with early notes on each system. Wrote brief summaries of their roles and initial impressions of extensibility.
- Sketched out a basic architecture chain (DAG → libp2p → DHT → API) as a starting point for deeper mapping later.

## Tasks Worked On

- [x] Spin up basic containers for remote testing
  - Used a Docker Compose config to launch 10 IPFS containers. Each one has isolated ports and persistent storage. No issues starting them up or accessing the HTTP API individually.
- [x] Clone and examine `helia`, `go-ipfs`, and `ipfs-cluster`
  - Cloned all three into local directories under the project root. Read through each repo’s README and browsed key folders (`core`, `cmd`, `internal`, etc.). Focused on getting a feel for structure and complexity.
- [x] Begin simple documentation tree:
  - Created three new Markdown files in `docs/`: one for each system. Logged notes on each one’s responsibilities, design focus, and questions for later.
  - Began a rough system map of how the components interact, but paused for now—further detail depends on experimental direction.
- [x] Construct log for 17th (this entry)

## Key Learnings / Takeaways

- Helia (JS/TS) is modular, focused on composability and web/browser environments. Emphasizes plug-and-play behavior, configurable transports, and modern dev ergonomics.
- Kubo (Go) is the reference node implementation. Bigger and more complex, but clearly built to be stable and extensible. API is mature, and the plugin/blockstore infrastructure allows for customization.
- IPFS Cluster is a separate layer that handles replication, coordination, and pinset management. It’s designed to run alongside Kubo nodes. Offers REST interfaces, and supports both Raft and CRDT-based consensus.
- These aren’t redundant tools—they handle different concerns. Helia = lightweight client + developer interface, Kubo = protocol anchor, Cluster = multi-node orchestration.

## Questions / Open Problems

- What would it take to run Helia nodes alongside Kubo+Cluster setups? Any shared state issues?
- Where is the best point in the stack to measure DHT query efficiency, Bitswap latency, or content resolution paths?
- What pain points (resource usage, flakiness, config drift) come up when scaling a cluster to 10+ nodes?

## Next Steps

- Read about Merkle DAGs
- Read about Kademlia DHT, focus on XOR stuff/bucket structure/routing
- libp2p transport stack basics
- answer question "how is content requested and resolved in IPFS"
