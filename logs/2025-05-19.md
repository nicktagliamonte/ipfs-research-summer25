# Daily Log — 2025-05-19

## Summary

- This was a more mechanical day where I ran some initial simple test on the cluster, and laid more groundwork as it relates to bootstrapping and setting up my IPFS swarm
- To that end, this is a more detailed log than most because it will be used as a reference point in the future as I familiarize myself with the IPFS commands

## Tasks Worked On

- [x] Spin up docker IPFS network
- [x] Connect them to my local node (manual bootstrapping with `ipfs swarm` connect)

  1. locally, ran ipfs daemon in a background terminal
  2. in another terminal, ran `ipfs id` and got the below output:

     "Protocols": [

     "/libp2p/dcutr",
     "/x/"
     ]
     }
     ```

  3. Ran `docker exec -it ipfs-nodeX /bin/sh` for all 10 nodes. from within the node, ran `ipfs swarm connect /ip4/10.0.0.182/tcp/4100/p2p/12D3KooWAwg3Dk6teYicx8K96FJPD3K1HWsLmH4HZw57uh1jgNss` to bootstrap them to my local daemon. Note that for future repeatability, `ipfs swarm connect <multiaddr>` will suffice, the addr may not be identical

- [x] Test file transfer between remote and local
  1. ran `ipfs add testfile.txt`: added QmQGTGNRnov3BjT33bEd6r24JZJqtbXTfxAh1qzmFtiruJ testfile.txt
  2. went into one of the remote node containers with `docker exec -it ipfs-node1 /bin/sh`
  3. in there, ran `ipfss cat <CID>`
  4. recieved the text of the textfile successfully
  5. (painstakingly) repeated the above test on the remaining 9 nodes, had success on all.
- [x] Document latency and peer discovery behavior
  1. ran `ipfs swarm peers | wc -l` from the local node and got a count of 227 peers.
  2. ran `ipfs ping -n 5 <peerID>` to the first 3 ids on the ipfs swarm peer list to send ICMP-style pings over libp2p to get round-trip times:

  ```
  3. ran `code/ipfs_ping_test.sh` to get an average latency for each of the 10 nodes, results in `results/ipfs_ping_test_results.txt`
  4. ran `code/run_file_transfer_tests.sh` to get an average latency for adding a simple file to each node and then getting that file from each of the remaining 9 nodes. results in `results/transfer_results.txt`

## Key Learnings / Takeaways

### 1. ipfs_ping_test_results.txt

- **Intra-cluster latency**: Most nodes reported extremely low average ping times (0.01–0.5 ms)because they are on the same local network or host.
- **Outliers**: A few nodes (e.g., ipfs-node1, ipfs-node9, ipfs-node10) showed higher average latencies (100–280 ms), suggesting either network segmentation or resource contention.
- **Consistency**: The results are consistent across repeated pings, with no major packet loss or timeouts observed.
- **Conclusion**: The cluster is well-connected, with most nodes able to communicate with minimal delay. Outlier nodes should be checked for network or resource issues.

### 2. transfer_results.txt

- **Add times**: Most nodes added files in under 2 seconds, but some (notably ipfs-node2, ipfs-node3, ipfs-node4, ipfs-node7, ipfs-node9) had much higher add times (up to 24s). This may indicate resource contention, cold start, or GC activity.
- **Retrieval times**: File retrieval between nodes was consistently fast (0.01–0.04s), regardless of which node originated the file. No failures or major delays were observed.
- **Reliability**: All transfers succeeded, indicating good cluster health and Bitswap performance for small files.
- **Conclusion**: File transfer within the cluster is reliable and fast, but add times are variable and should be investigated further for nodes with high latency.

---

**Overall:**

- The IPFS cluster demonstrates low-latency communication and reliable file transfer for small files. Occasional high add times and ping outliers may warrant further investigation, but no critical issues are apparent from this quick check.

## Questions / Open Problems

- What is the source of the higher add times for a couple of nodes?
- What kind of network activity are these nodes subject to outside of the local tests I am running? What data are they being used to store, and how is it being accessed?

## Next Steps

- Upload 10–20 files, test pinning + unpinning
- Trigger garbage collection and observe space reclaiming
- Examine .ipfs/blocks and .ipfs/datastore
- Record which commands clean what
