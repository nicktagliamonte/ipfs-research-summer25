# Research Logs

This directory contains daily logs for the independent study **"Exploring the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS): A Systems and Research-Oriented Independent Study"** conducted by Nick Tagliamonte in Summer 2025.

## Structure

Each log is a separate Markdown file named using the ISO 8601 date format:

YYYY-MM-DD.md  

## Purpose

These logs serve as a running research journal — tracking:
- Progress on tasks and deliverables
- Key insights, questions, or challenges
- Observations from reading, coding, experiments
- Thoughts about the system’s behavior and design

They may also include command outputs, links, diagrams, or code snippets.

## Privacy

Logs may include personal thoughts and intermediate notes. If needed, more polished summaries will be moved into shared reports or presentations.
