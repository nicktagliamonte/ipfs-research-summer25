# Daily Log — 2025-05-16

## Summary

- Installed and tested IPFS implementations (go-ipfs, js-ipfs, and Helia).
- Encountered deprecation of js-ipfs and transitioned to Helia for forward compatibility.
- Successfully created, stored, and retrieved data using Helia in Node.js.
- Began structuring project directories and setting up a research log template.
- Faced some networking errors with Helia’s UDP sockets, turned out to be a port conflict baseed on
  - ```
      sudo lsof -i UDP:44377
    [sudo] password for nicktagliamonte:
    COMMAND  PID            USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
    chrome  7697 nicktagliamonte   22u  IPv4 246785      0t0  UDP *:44377
    ```

## Tasks Worked On
- [x] Organized project directories into a Git repository with folders for logs, code, and notes.
- [x] Installed go-ipfs and attempted js-ipfs on local Fedora machine. Verified basic `ipfs add`, `cat`, and `dag` commands.
  - Note: Although the eventual goal is to set up multiple Kubo nodes with IPFS Cluster, for now the focus is on installing and running minimum software.
  - Experimented with DAG structures; created parent/child node links visualized in `ipfs_dag_test.png`.
  - Noted that js-ipfs is deprecated and succeeded by Helia, so shifted focus accordingly.
  - Installed Helia and dependencies via npm, centralized under `code/node_modules`.
  - Created initial test script (`code/index.js`) to write and read data from a Helia node, visualized in `helia_rw_test.png`.
- [x] Started research log in Markdown format with a daily template to streamline weekly reports.
  - The template may be more detailed than necessary, but should help maintain consistent documentation. Will adjust if too cumbersome.
- [x] Read “IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System” and logged key takeaways.

## Key Learnings / Takeaways
- Helia is the recommended modern IPFS implementation for JavaScript, replacing js-ipfs.
- Helia’s API differs from js-ipfs, requiring new patterns for content addition and retrieval.
- Networking errors related to UDP socket binding on Fedora may be due to port conflicts or firewall settings; need to troubleshoot further.
- DAG linking concepts reinforced through hands-on experimentation, visualizing node relationships aids understanding.

## Questions / Open Problems
- How does HTTPS improve upon HTTP as a distributed file system, particularly in ways that overlap with the benefits of P2P or IPFS?
- In what ways does IPFS remain theoretically or practically advantageous compared to HTTPS-based systems?
- How does Helia handle peer discovery compared to go-ipfs or Kubo?
- How to effectively orchestrate multiple Helia nodes to simulate a cluster environment?

## Next Steps
- TODO!!!
